# Echo Flutter News

This academic project, titled "Echo Flutter News", was designed to explore and learn the fundamentals of Flutter for cross-platform mobile development. The goal was to develop a fully functional news application with modern UI/UX while integrating real-world features to enhance user experience and engagement.



## Features
- **State Management** : Implemented effective state management techniques for dynamic data rendering and user interactions
- **Firebase Authentication** : Sign up using email and password
- **Pagination**: The news articles are loaded in batches of 10 articles
- **Filtering** : Filter news by category
- **Search** : Search for news by search term
- **Sorting** : Sort news by date, popularity or relevancy
- **Favorites** : Save news to favorites
- **Animations** : Added engaging animations (e.g., fade-in effects, scale transitions) to enhance user experience and make the interface more interactive

- **Avatar Selection** : Select randomly an avatar for your profile
- **Open In Browser** : Open the full news article in the default browser

## Getting Started

### Using the newsapi.org API

1. Create an account on [newsapi.org](https://newsapi.org/).

2. Get your API key.

3. Create a file named '.env' in the root directory of the project (not in the lib folder).

4. Add the following line to the .env file and replace <YOUR_API_KEY> with your API key.

`API_KEY='<YOUR_API_KEY>'`

5. Create a project on [firebase](https://console.firebase.google.com/).

6. Add and enable firebase authentication with email and password.

7. Add and enable firebase firestore (for saving favorite articles).

8. Make sure you have the firebase CLI installed.

9. Run flutterfire configure and connect your app to your firebase project.

10. Run the app.

## Learning Outcomes

- **Flutter Widgets**: Gained hands-on experience with foundational Flutter widgets, layouts, and styling.
- **State Management**: Explored the use of `StatefulWidget`, `InheritedWidget`, and basic provider patterns to manage app states effectively.
- **RESTful APIs**: Learned how to consume APIs, parse JSON data, and manage network calls asynchronously.
- **Firebase Integration**: Understood how to integrate backend services for authentication and data persistence.
- **Animations**: Enhanced UI interactivity using animation controllers, transitions, and tweening.
- **Cross-Platform Development**: Built a single codebase for both Android and iOS platforms, adhering to best practices.
